# Sapphire Template

## Instructions:
1.) Clone Repo

2.) Type `npm i` to install all deps

3.) Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in `DISCORD_TOKEN` and add your guild ids to `GUILD_IDS`

4.) Type `npm run dev` to have it autorestart on changes, or type `npm run start` to have it only start once.

I provided a __BaseCommand.ts for you to use to copy paste into new commands, and a basic Ping Pong command in src/commands. Enjoy!
